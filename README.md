# crafting-interpreters
This repository contains work done while going through Robert Nystrom's Crafting Interpreters online text ([text](http://craftinginterpreters.com/), [github repo](https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters)) building interpreters for the "Lox" language, a toy language with a pretty minimal set of operations

Currently this includes a python-based lox interpreter implementing more or less what is described in Part 2 of the book but in Python instead of Java.
